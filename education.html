              <h2>CBD</h2>
              <p>Overview of CBD:<br>
                Cannabidol is the non-intoxicated chemical in the Marijuana plant opposed to the popular chemical THC.</p>
              <p>Side effects of CBD:<br>
                Dr. J Matthew Andry, MD states "... Most CBD extracts administered at common doses tend to promote calmness and reduce anxiety." 
                Dr. J Matthew Andry is a professor of medicine at Indiana University, and an expert on cannabis medicine. CBD can promote 
                calmness by impeding anandamide absorption. Anandamide is an endocannabinoid that promotes and manages homeostasis, the body's 
                natural state of equilibrium. Also, CBD can help with insomnia, inflammatory issues, and help with easing pain and anxiety.<br><br>

              <h2>Intake Products</h2>
              <p>Ways to consume Cannabis:<br>
                Cannabis can be consumed in numerous ways, scroll down to find out more.</p>
              
              <h4>Smoking</h4>
              <p>There are several ways to consume cannabis that includes smoking it through a water pipe or commonly referred to as bongs, 
                through a hand pipe, rolled up in a marijuana joint (aka marijuana cigarette) or in a blunt (cannabis is wrapped with a 
                thicker material that can be made from hemp, tobacco, or other plant materials).<br><br>
                Some people get creative and make bongs or pipes out of different types of materials such as an apple as making such an 
                object is relatively easy. Smoking cannabis is the typical way to consume cannabis.<br><br>
                Patients and adults typically feel the effects virtually immediately and the effects last around three hours.</p>
              
              <h4>Vaping</h4>
              <p>Another way to consume cannabis is through utilization of vaporization. Vaporization differs from smoking because vaping 
                does not include the combustion of the plant materials, but rather the plant material is surrounded by a heated element that 
                essentially cooks the cannabis to produce a vapor. Patients and adults sometimes prefer this method to avoid consuming any 
                carcinogenic chemicals that can come from combustion. Through observations and informal testing vaping plant material could be safer than smoking. <br><br>
                Patients and adults typically feel the effects virtually immediately and the effects last around three hours.<br><br>
                The result that is left when the user is done with a session is called ABV (already been vaped) cannabis. ABV can be reused to create edibles, scroll down to learn more.</p>
              <h4>Edibles</h4>
              <p>In addition to vaping and smoking, cannabis can also be consumed through edibles. Edibles is food or beverages that have 
                cannabis active chemicals in them. The most popular type of edibles happen to be brownies however, with the wave of 
                legalization charging the country edibles have taken new forms such as gummies, chocolate, cold beverages, capsules, and many more. <br><br>
                Edibles take up to 1-2 hours to begin feeling the effects and they can last for up to 4 hours depending on the potency. 
                In states that allow children to medicate under adult supervision, edibles and capsules and those who cannot or do not want 
                to consume cannabis through smoking or vaping forms. <br>Patients and qualifying adults can make edibles in a few ways:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Creating infused cannabis oil (butter, coconut, olive, etc) and add it to cooking or baking </li>
                  <li>Mixing ABV into high fat contents</li>
                  <li>Incorporating cannabis concentrate right into the dish that is being prepared</li>
                </ul>

              <h4>Dabbing</h4>
              <p>Another popular way to consume cannabis is through dabbing, dabbing is when the user heats up a quartz glass banger, ceramic nail, 
                titanium nail, or electronic nail (E-Nails) to a hot enough temperature to melt and vaporize cannabis concentrate (aka live resin, shatter, butters, etc.). <br><br>
                Cannabis extract has a higher potency than cannabis flower because budtenders and those alike utilized heated presses to squash cannabis flower that is 
                in a micron bag (vary in sizes) and wrapped in parchment paper. After the completion of the cannabis extraction process, budtenders are left with cannabis concentrates. <br><br>
                Dabbing is best for those who have experience with cannabis and need a high potency of THC or CBD. Experience is not required however, for those who do not have an 
                e-nail persons would require to obtain a torch (propane-fueled) to heat up the nail which can be dangerous if persons aren't sure how to dab. </p>
              <h5>Quick Dab Tips</h5>
              <p>What you'll need:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Cannabis extract</li>
                  <li>Water pipe</li>
                  <li>Nail</li>
                  <li>Carb: An apparatus that is used to cover the nail to trap the vapor.</li>
                  <li>Torch</li>
                  <li>Dab tool</li>
                </ul>
                <ol type="1">
                  <li>When you have all your items together begin by serving yourself the amount of concentrate you want/need with your dab tool. Be sure to not to use 
                    too much as it may not melt thoroughly. If you are using an e-nail preheat your nail between 540°F- 600°F.</li>
                  <li>Next, heat up your nail with direct heat from the torch, while it's connected to your water pipe, heat up until your nail becomes red-hot. Once the 
                    nail is red-hot, turn off your torch and wait about 10 seconds for titanium nails and ~45 seconds for a quartz banger. This is to prevent inhaling 
                    carcinogens from taking too hot of a dab.</li>
                  <li>After you have waited, take your loaded dab tool and apply it directly on the nail and inhale slowly. Once you've placed the dab on the nail, grab 
                    your carb cap and trap the vapor.</li>
                  <li>Exhale and relax.</li>
                </ol>

              <h4>Plants</h4>
              <p>The cannabis plant comes in a few different forms, here are some of them.</p>

              <h5>Indica</h5>
              <p>Indica marijuana strains can be identified by their short, bushy, wide leaves. Indica strains have been known to grow faster than their sativa counterpart. <br>
                Indica can help:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Mental relaxation</li>
                  <li>Muscle relaxation</li>
                  <li>Decrease nausea</li>
                  <li>Decrease acute pain</li>
                  <li>Increase appetite</li>
                  <li>Increase dopamine</li>
                </ul>
              <p>Those who have struggled with insomnia can also benefit from Indica or indica-dominant strains.</p>

              <h5>Sativa</h5>
              <p>Sativa cannabis strains differ from indica visually as sativas have tall narrow leaves with lighter green shade. Sativa requires more light, resources, and 
                time than indica however, sativas tend to have higher THC to CBD ratio than indica. <br>
                Sativa strains help with: </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Anti-anxiety</li>
                  <li>Anti-depressant</li>
                  <li>Treat chronic pain</li>
                  <li>Increase focus</li>
                  <li>Increase appetite</li>
                  <li>Increase serotonin </li>
                </ul>
              <h5>Hybrids</h5>
              <p>Hybrids are as their name suggests, a combination of indica and sativa strain. Users utilize 
                these when they do not want so much of an effect of either strain. </p>
              <h5>Ruderalis</h5>
              <p>Ruderalis are a species of cannabis that grows naturally despite its environment and natural disturbances to its area and contains naturally low THC.</p>
