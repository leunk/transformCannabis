            <h2>Overview of the History of Cannabis</h2>
            <p>Cannabis can first be noticed around 500 BC used in ancient cultures as a medicinal herb. <br><br>
              The first instance of cannabis in America was when our early colonial ancestors brought over 
              hemp from the motherland. The main use of the hemp cultivated at this time was used for ropes and fabric. <br><br>

              Currently in the 20th century cannabis has taken a negative form in the United States due to the criminalization done in 1937 
              and the racial factors that had been implemented heavily during the 1970's when the war on drugs was declared. Although 
              cannabis is becoming legal in different states across the nation, cannabis is still a schedule 1 drug therefore is federally illegal. <br><br>
              Cannabis is a fast-growing plant that is generally a painless plant to cultivate which is why cannabis is so widely available in 
              many different countries. Cannabis is hypothesized to originate in Asia that then was spread across Africa, then made its way to 
              Europe, and finally made its way to America. <br><br>
              Cannabis is composed of different chemicals, the main two are tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) the psychoactive chemical that gives users 
              a euphoric sense after use and cannabidiol (CBD) the non-intoxicating chemical produced by the plant.  <br><br>

            <h2>History of Marijuana Prohibition</h2>
            <p>The history of Marijuana prohibition in the United States begins around the early 1900's shortly after the Mexican Revolution. After 
              the conclusion of the Mexican Revolution, many immigrants made their way to the United States. With the surge of new Americans 
              entering the country, the public had been overly concerned about their new fellow Americans. This concern influenced the media to 
              utilize scare tactics to paint Mexican-Americans in a dangerous and disruptive light. This led to the exoneration of Mexicans and 
              Mexican-Americans.  The media succeeded in scaring the public into thinking that "marihuana", how Mexicans referred to cannabis. <br><br>
              With the public fearing Mexican-Americans and the media spreading false attributes it was no problem for the public and fellow Americans 
              to demonize cannabis in conjunction with demonizing Mexicans and Mexican-Americans. Texan citizens were stalking their new neighbors and 
              finding ways to control them to their benefit. Texans figured that if they could find a way to search, detain, and deport their new 
              neighbors, that they would end up doing more good on behalf of the country. <br><br>
              Marijuana was the way Texan citizens were able to control the Mexican immigrant population in the United States.  <br><br>
              In the 1930's there was a hearing for the marijuana law. In this hearing claims were made that "marijuana has the ability to cause men of 
              color to become violent and solicit sex from white women." By the end of the hearing the Marihuana Tax Act of 1937 was born and successfully 
              forbade the use and sales of marijuana. The Marihuana Tax Act was deemed unconstitutional several years after it had been enacted.  <br><br>

            <h2>History of Marijuana Legalization</h2>
            <p>In 1996, California became the first state to approve use for marijuana for medicinal purposes. This was a big step for cannabis advocates as it 
              ended 59 years of declining that marijuana had 0 medical purposes.  <br><br>
              Those against medical marijuana deemed that marijuana does not have enough research and information that would warrant medical use of the cannabis 
              plant. Cannabis advocates point out that cannabis had been used medicinally for over 5,000 years and the demonization had stumpt cannabis as a medicine. <br><br>

              Currently there are 11 states, including Washington D.C.  where cannabis is legal for recreational use for persons 21+ and 33 states where medical 
              cannabis is legal. Although cannabis is legal in some states, it is still federally illegal. Without the federal government lifting the ban on cannabis, 
              the United States are not allowed to research or test marijuana for scientific observation or obtain qualitative data. <br><br>
