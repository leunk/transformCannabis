            <h2>Your Rights</h2>
            <p>Per the Fourth Amendment to the Bill of Rights of the United States Constitution: <br>
              "The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, 
              shall not be violates, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly 
              describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized."</p>
            </div>
            <p>Here are a couple of tips when dealing with the law:</p>
            <ol type="1">
              <li>Do NOT leave contraband in plain view:</li>
                <p>If you happen to find yourself in a law enforcement search after they have obtained a search warrant, any illicit materials 
                  or objects are at risk of confiscation if they are in a non-invasive point of view. If objects are found and confiscated, it 
                  is most likely to be followed with an arrest.</p>
              <li>Never Consent</li>
                <p>If you find yourself in a situation where a law enforcement officer is requesting to search your person, house, or automobile; 
                  you are allowed to say no. Usually officers do this because there might not be enough evidence to warrant an arrest or because 
                  the officer does not want to go through the process of obtaining a warrant. If you do consent to the search you have waived your 
                  constitutional protection and the officers may search and seize materials and items without hesitation or authorization. <br><br>
                  Here is a example polite response when an officer is requesting to search you: 
                  "I do not consent to a search of my [person, baggage, purse, luggage, vehicle, house, blood, etc.] I do not consent to this contact 
                  and do not want to answer any questions. If I am not under arrest, I would like to go now (or be left alone)." <br> 
                  Quote from <a href="https://norml.org/legal/your-rights">NORML</a></p>
              <li>Do NOT answer questions without a attorney present</li>
                <p>Regardless if you are under arrest, you should always exercise your right to remain silent. Anything you say to anyone (friends, 
                  family, officer, press, cell mate, etc) has the possibility to be used as evidence against you in the court of law per Miranda warning.</p>
              <li>Discovering if you are free to go</li>
                <p>If you find yourself in a situation with an officer and you want to know if you are able to leave, you can ask the officer if you are 
                  under arrest. If the answer is no, you are by law free to leave the scene/ premise and continue the rest of your schedule. <br><br>
                  Please note that officers do have the right to detain you without arresting you if the officer has a “reasonable suspicion” that you may 
                  be involved with criminal activity. If you are temporarily detained the officer have the ability to perform a “pat down” or “frisk” if 
                  the officer believes that you may have a weapon on your person however, officers are only allowed to reach into your pockets if they feel something like a weapon. <br><br>
                  If you have completed the search and the officer has questions or wants to contact you you are able to ask if you are under arrest, again if the answer is no, you are free to go.</p>
              <li>Do NOT be hostile or physically resist</li>
                <p>Becoming hostile or physically resisting can be dangerous and end up adding charges on your record, so here are some tips t=o take when your rights have been violated.<br><br>
                  If you find yourself in an uncomfortable situation with an officer, just be respectful, remember your right to remain silent, and listen to what the officer has 
                  to say. If an officer proceeds to detain, search, or arrest you rather than becoming physically resistant, you should reassert your rights to decline consent.</p>
              <li>Police Informant </li>
                <p>In some cases police and prosecutors will try to pressure you into giving up information on others that could lead to the arrest and conviction 
                  of others. More often than not, prosecutors and law enforcement officials will attempt to persuade you by making promises that may or may not happen 
                  or by intimidating you with threats that may or may not be true. It is best to take these promises and threats with a grain of salt and to evaluate 
                  your decisions with a expert criminal defense attorney. <br><br>
