              <h2>Issues</h2>
              <p>Here are some of the issues surrounding medical marijuana (MMJ) in Florida and possibly other states who are in a similar situation like Florida.</p>
              <h4>Florida Legalization Bust?</h4>
              <p>One major issue that arises is that Florida is that current marijuana treatment centers (MTC) or medical dispensaries are the number one funder 
                for Make It Legal Florida. Make It Legal Florida is a petition group who had attempted to put Recreational Marijuana Use on the 2020 ballot. 
                Although the petition did not make it on the ballot, this may have been a blessing in disguise for Floridians as the proposed bill would not 
                allow for home cultivation, regardless of the other 27 states that allow it. <br><br>
                While this puzzles some, the right to home cultivation would allow Floridians to open up their own shops or dispensaries to create and sell items 
                that have been made by them. Having the right to home cultivation is imperative for Florida's Marijuana Laws because if not, MTC companies would 
                be able to monopolize the cannabis industry which would do more harm to the cannabis industry than good. <br><br>
                Floridians are hopeful that there will be a petition that meets everyone's needs and that 2022 will be the year for recreational use for Florida. 
                It is imperative for Florida voters to research the petitions they are signing as some groups aren't as transparent as others. <br><br>

              <h4>THC Limits</h4>
              <p>Currently a proposal made by House lawmakers, that seeks to erratically cap the potency of medical cannabis flower to 10% THC is under consideration in Florida. <br><br>
                There are currently over 30 states that provide medical marijuana to their citizens, they do not create similar restrictions. <br><br>
                In addition to sister states not implementing restrictions on THC, implementing THC caps could be harmful for current patients as it would take more 
                marijuana to reach the same relief. This could promote current patients to find another more dangerous substance or resort to purchasing cannabis through the 
                black market. All in all THC limits would not be in current medical marijuana patients best interest. <br><br>
                Send an urgent message to your senator in opposition to THC limits! <br><br>
                Example message to your Senator: <br>
                Lawmakers are considering a proposal to arbitrarily cap the potency of cannabis flowers at ten percent THC. I urge you to oppose the passage of this type of legislation. <br><br>
                Over thirty states provide medical cannabis access; virtually none of these impose similar restrictions. That is because such a cap is arbitrary and is not in the best 
                interest of patients who deserve the legal option to access varying strains of cannabis of varying potencies. Just as patients currently have access to pain medications 
                of various strengths, patients should similarly have access to herbal cannabis of varying potency. <br><br>
                Further, this restriction is inconsistent with the spirit of Florida's voter-approved medical cannabis access law, which provided no limits regarding THC potency. Lawmakers should not intervene in this manner. <br><br>
                Finally, it must be acknowledged that THC is not toxic nor can it cause lethal overdose, regardless of potency. Currently, doctors may legally prescribe oral, synthetic THC 
                (Marinol) that is 100 percent THC. Despite its potency, this drug is well acknowledged to be safe and effective. <br><br>
                For these reasons, I urge you to oppose efforts to limit THC potency. <br><br>
